WHAT WE’D LOVE YOU TO DO (AND LOVE DOING)



     You act as owner of a core platform product defining and driving a medium to long term roadmap and backlog. 
     In collaboration with other product and business leaders across Zalando you discover new network capabilities and platform services with a solid understanding of the trade-offs in the logistic supply chain. 
     You lead complex, cross-team initiatives that solve customer problems and drive business impact and use data-driven insights and your understanding of Zalando's fulfillment models to make informed decisions and enhance customer lifetime value. 
     You apply best-practice product methodologies to guide projects from problem definition to solution delivery and enjoy collaborating with diverse teams to unlock the potential of our central fulfillment platform, connecting various aspects of our business. 
     You author/co-author product documents including a product roadmap, problem and pitch papers, definition of business requirements, and functional specifications. 



WE’D LOVE TO MEET YOU IF



     You understand your customers, users, stakeholders and your product’s capabilities inside out. You have attention to detail and a deep love for a good metric that shows the quality and performance of your product. 
     Your analytical mind allows you to think in patterns, create scalable domain models and define generic capabilities out of specific use cases. You think “platform”, not only “feature”. 
     That also means you can break complex problems up into bite-size pieces and are able to explain them to stakeholders and engineers. You can keep it simple. 
     You know methods to find the most valuable opportunities, slicing your solution to maximize return on investment and therefore revenue, efficiency or customer satisfaction. 
     You have strong communication (verbal, written and visual) skills and are able to manage projects with many dependencies. 
     You start with a “yes” and remain a curious mind, when engaging with your stakeholders or engineers. You don’t necessarily end with a “yes”, though. You stay calm in times of uncertainty or ambiguous priorities and help the teams to gain focus again.
