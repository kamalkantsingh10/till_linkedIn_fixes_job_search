      Owned delivery of next-gen ML/Optimization products and algorithms that reduced transportation costs and improved delivery speeds for global markets including NA, EU and Japan. Led a team of 3 TPM and 2 PMs. Responsibilities included technical strategy, execution of 5 workstreams, alignment of global stakeholders, and establishing success metrics. 
      Owned  execution of 3FY roadmap to upgrade and connect ML/Optimization models to design middle-mile networks across NA,EU and Japan;. year 1 resulted in savings of $30M Japan and $28M in EU. Also plan was to create extensive data collection and analysis using error detection and collection. We were also supposed to create a extensive dashboard showing 160+ metric. 5 technical workstreams with a team of 3 TPMs and 2 PMs, keeping 45+ ML engineers/scientists across 8 global teams unblocked and aligned.
      Developed and aligned 3FY roadmap at amazon to build next-gen ML/optimization ecosystem  to transform network planning; aligned 45+ business teams on this plan projected annual savings > $350M/yr
      Merged 15 evaluation models to a single pipeline that helped create one standard platform for all the analytics related to evaluate network plan against; estimated impact 50Mn. We created a pipeline that sourced data from 35 new sources cleaned and made ready to process
      designed a Data collection and governance system to collect data from 500+ teams/individuals across EU and set up mechanisms to review and validate with goal of improving data inputs to the Optimization Models 
      Led collaboration with 40+ stakeholder teams including finance, operations, planning across NA, EU, and Japan.
      LED Technical development of 5 technical workstreams with a  PMO of 3 Technical Program managers and 2 Product Managers, keeping 45+ ML engineers/scientists across 8 global teams unblocked and aligned.
      Launched in Japan, achieved entitlement of $30M in the first year through improved network speed and cost. This was done within 6 months. We project to deploy another 50 min in the year 2
      Prototyped a framework to execute ML/Optimization models with hundreds of 'what-if' scenarios, resulting in a network plan $14M cheaper (vs baseline). This showed a interactive dashboard that network planners can use to evaluate these and choose the best one. This impacted decision based on data backed on more than 100 metrics. We did a simulation with 10000 runs that lead to sensitivity analysis of various factors like transportations buildings
      Led monthly/quarterly reviews with senior stakeholders including VPs in JP, EU and NA with presence of 40 stakeholder teams
